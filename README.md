# Optimizing PyTorch 2.7 for MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) on Apple Silicon

PyTorch's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend enables deep learning workloads to leverage Apple's GPU hardware on M1, M2, M3, and M4 devices. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of optimizations, limitations, and best practices for maximizing performance with PyTorch 2.7 on Apple Silicon.

## Memory Management Optimizations

Memory management is critical for MPS performance due to the unified memory architecture of Apple Silicon. Several techniques can help optimize memory usage:

### Memory Limits Configuration

PyTorch offers environment variables and functions to control memory allocation on MPS devices:

```python
# Option 1: Set environment variables before importing torch
import os
os.environ["PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO"] = "1.5"  # Default: 1.7
os.environ["PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO"] = "1.2"   # Default: 1.4

# Option 2: Use the API
import torch
torch.mps.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.9)  # Use up to 90% of available memory
```

### Memory Release Mechanisms

```python
# Clear unused cached memory
torch.mps.empty_cache()
```

Use this especially after large operations or between epochs to prevent memory fragmentation.

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Gradient Management

Use this approach for gradient reset (faster than `optimizer.zero_grad()`):

```python
for param in model.parameters():
    param.grad = None
```

### Gradient Checkpointing

For memory-constrained training:

```python
from torch.utils.checkpoint import checkpoint

def forward(self, x):
    x = checkpoint(self.expensive_layer, x)
    return x
```

### Batch Size Optimization

To simulate large batches via gradient accumulation:

```python
optimizer.zero_grad()
for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(loader):
    outputs = model(inputs.to("mps"))
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets.to("mps"))
    (loss / accumulation_steps).backward()
    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### Manual Mixed Precision

MPS lacks full AMP support. This is the manual alternative:

```python
inputs = inputs.to(torch.float16).to("mps")
with torch.autocast(device_type="mps", dtype=torch.float16, enabled=False):
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets.to("mps"))
loss.backward()
```

## Known Limitations and Workarounds

### Float64 Precision Limitation

Convert to float32 before moving models to MPS:

```python
model_data = torch.load("model.pt", map_location="cpu")
for k in model_data:
    if isinstance(model_data[k], torch.Tensor) and model_data[k].dtype == torch.float64:
        model_data[k] = model_data[k].float()
model_data = model_data.to("mps")
```

### Data Loading

Avoid `pin_memory=True` for MPS:

```python
# Recommended:
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
inputs = inputs.to("mps", non_blocking=True)
```

### MPS Fallback

To allow CPU fallback:

```python
import os
os.environ["PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK"] = "1"
```

## Operator Support Status

Many operations are still not supported on MPS (e.g., grid_sampler_3d, some linear algebra ops). Use:

```python
os.environ["PYTORCH_MPS_LOG_LEVEL"] = "1"
```

To log fallbacks when running a model.

## Profiling and Analysis

### MPS Profiler

```python
with torch.mps.profiler.profile(mode="interval", wait_until_completed=True) as p:
    output = model(input_tensor)
```

### Metal Capture (advanced)

```python
if torch.mps.is_metal_capture_enabled():
    with torch.mps.metal_capture():
        output = model(input_tensor)
```

## `torch.compile` on MPS (PyTorch 2.7)

Still experimental:

```python
model = torch.compile(model, backend="mps")
```

Known issues: operator fallbacks, shader generation bugs. Stable support expected in PyTorch 2.8+.

## Conclusion

To optimize PyTorch on MPS:

* Set memory limits via environment variables or API
* Use `torch.mps.empty_cache()` strategically
* Avoid `pin_memory` 
* Use gradient accumulation and checkpointing for large models
* Profile fallbacks and memory pressure via logging and Metal tools
* Use float64 on cpu and convert to float32 before sending to mps
MPS support is improving steadily â€” but still requires targeted optimization on Apple Silicon.
